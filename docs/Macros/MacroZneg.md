<h1><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zneg</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#zneg" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The zneg keyword is a problem solving tool that allows the user to zero out geometric coefficients that represent negative areas. It is useful for investigating causes of instability in highly-nonlinear simulations. A message will be written to the output file that states how many coefficients were set to zero.</p>
<p>Use with caution as the numerical grid will no longer be consistent in the mathematical sense.</p>
