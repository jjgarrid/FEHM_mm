# System Interface

## System-Dependent Features

In addition to standard intrinsic math routines only two system routines are required by the FEHM code. The code uses a system call to get the date (subroutine dated) and a system routine to get the CPU clock time (subroutine tyming).

## Compiler Requirements

FEHM Version 2.30 is written for Fortran 90. FEHM has been successfully compiled and run on SUN, PC, Linux and macOS computers. 

## Hardware Requirements

No special hardware features or environments are required by the software. The code will run on SUN workstations running Solaris 7 or later (UNIX), PC workstations running Windows 2000 or later, Linux 2.4.18 or later, and macOS Snow Leopard or later. Memory requirements depend on the problem being modeled (based on the number of nodes). It is suggested that the system being used have a minimum of 128 MB of memory.

## Control Sequences or Command Files

None.

## Software Environment

N/A
