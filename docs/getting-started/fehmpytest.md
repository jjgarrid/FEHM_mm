# FehmPyTests Suite


Fehmpytests is a new test suite for FEHM. Its goal is to enable FEHM developers 
to easily test new code and add new tests for existing or future functionality. Currently, there are
17 tests that Fehmpytests performs through a command line interface.  
Future plans are to integrate it into the FEHM build process and provide more 
modularity by improving the devloper interface. 

Fehmpytests requires Python 3
